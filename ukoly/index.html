            <h2>Linear Equations</h2>
            
            <div> <span>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form <span> </div>
            
            <div class="cisla"><p>ax + b = 0</p></div>
             
            <div>where <span class="marked">a</span> and <span class="marked">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="marked">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also the variable may or may not be <span class="marked">x</span> an so dont et too locked into always seeing an <span class="marked">x</span> there</div>

            <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>

            <Div>the standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this</Div>

            <div class="cisla"> <p>ax <sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</p></div>

            <Div>wher <span class="marked">a, b, c</span> are know values and <span class="marked">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we dont know it yet) Also <span class="marked">a</span> cant be 0</Div>

            <h2>The arey of a circle (A)</h2>

            <div><span class="marked">π</span> (Pi) times the radius <span class="marked">(r)</span> squared:</div>
            
            <div class="cisla"><p>A = π x r <sup>2</sup></p></div>

            <div>or, when you know the diameter <span class="marked">(D)</span>:</div>

            <div class="cisla"><p>A = (π/4) x D <sup>2</sup></p></div>

            <div>or, when you know the circumference <span class="marked">(C)</span>:</div>

            <div class="cisla"><p>A = C <sup>2</sup>/ 4 x π</p></div>

            <h2>Intersection</h2>

            <div>the intersection of two sets <span class="marked">A</span> and <span class="marked">B</span>, denoted by A U B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols, </div>

            <div class="cisla"> <p>A U B = {x : x E A and x E B}</p></div>

            <div>That is, <span class="marked"> x</span> is an element of the intersection A U B if and only if <span class="marked">x</span> is both an element of <SPAN class="marked">A</SPAN> and an element of <span class="marked">B</span>.</div>
